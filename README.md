# ðŸ§± HTML Fundamentals & Semantic Web Pages

This project focuses on mastering the **core principles of HTML** â€” including structure, semantics, and accessibility.  
It consists of two main parts:
1. Converting plain text documents into semantic HTML pages.  
2. Building a multi-page website from a provided **Figma design** (Home, Services, and Contact pages).

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

The goal of this project was to strengthen understanding of **HTML semantics** and the ability to translate both written and visual content into well-structured web pages.  

By completing this project, I learned to:
- Apply appropriate semantic HTML elements (`header`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`, etc.).  
- Organize content meaningfully for both users and screen readers.  
- Interpret and convert Figma designs into real, accessible HTML layouts.

## ðŸ§  Part 1: Text-to-HTML Conversion (Recipe and Dictionary)

Two text documents were provided, each requiring conversion into HTML while maintaining a **logical document hierarchy** and **readable content flow**.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Proper use of headings and paragraph structure.  
- Semantic grouping of content (lists, quotes, emphasis tags).  
- Clean indentation and readability in code.

## ðŸŽ¨ Part 2: Figma Design to HTML

A three-page design was provided via Figma, representing:
- **Home Page**
- **Services Page**
- **Contact Page**

**Implementation Goals:**
- Accurately reproduce the visual layout using HTML structure only (no CSS focus).  
- Maintain consistent navigation between pages.  
- Ensure semantic correctness throughout all files.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **HTML** â€“ for structure and semantics

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes

- Gained confidence in writing clean, semantic HTML.  
- Improved understanding of document structure and accessibility.  
- Learned how to interpret Figma layouts and convert them into code.
